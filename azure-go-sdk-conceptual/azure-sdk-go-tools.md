# Tools for developers using the Azure SDK for Go

To be effective at writing Go code and have it work seamlessly with Azure services, here are some recommended tools.

## Azure CLI 2.0

The Azure 2.0 CLI provides a command-line interface to create and configure Azure resources in your subscriptions. The CLI can help you get started building common and shared Azure resources quickly, so that you can focus on more complex usage of services. The CLI has query and filtering features so you can pipe output directly to your favorite command-line tools. The CLI is available for installation on your local system, as a Docker image, or through [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight editor that has comprehensive support for the Go language through extensions. These extensions 
include support for features like autocomplete, `impl` templates, refactoring, and debugging. Visual Studio Code also offers many 
extensions for common developer tools such as source control, and even offers extensions for direct interactions with Azure services. 
Microsoft maintains an official meta-extension including these Azure extensions, including an interactive interface for the Azure CLI.

## Dependency management with dep

There are many ways to manage your package dependencies and do vendoring with Go, since there is no official solution yet. The
recommended way to perform this management is with the `dep` dependency manager. 
The Azure SDK for Go uses dep for its vendoring, and is guaranteed to correctly get dependencies for any other project using dep.

## Telemetry with Application Insights

[Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/) is an analytics product that allows
you to easily collect telemetry information from your applications and integrates with the Azure ecosystem, Visual Studio Team
Services, and GitHub. It can be used in many applications, and Microsoft offers a Go SDK for working with Application Insights.
